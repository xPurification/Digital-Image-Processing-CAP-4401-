# MATLAB Image Processing LiveScript

This MATLAB LiveScript demonstrates basic image processing operations using a demo image. The script allows you to:

1. Read an image into a workspace variable.
2. Display the original image.
3. Apply a filter to the image (Sepia Tone).
4. Display the processed image.
5. Save the resulting image to a .png file.

## Instructions

1. The script will prompt you to select a demo image. Choose a demo image to continue.

2. The original image will be displayed, followed by the processed image.

3. The processed image will be saved as a .png file in the same location as the original image.
